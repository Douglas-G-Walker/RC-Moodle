Tables:
	dbo.mdl_enrolments_ARCH
	
Views:
	dbo.mdl_courses
	dbo.mdl_enrolments

Scalar-valued Functions:
	dbo.mdl_academic_period
	dbo.mdl_category
	
	
	
Procedure:
		
1) Set Moodle to "Keep user enroled" on the external database enrolment plugin properties page

2) Create static table at end of semester named:  dbo.mdl_enrolments_PREVIOUSTERMCODE (ie. dbo.mdl_enrolments_201420)
		
		CREATE TABLE [dbo].[mdl_enrolments_PREVIOUSTERMCODE]
		(
			[idnumber] [varchar](255) NULL,
			[courseid] [varchar](100) NULL,
			[role] [varchar](100) NULL
		)
		
3) Populate the new table with the current data from mdl_enrolments
	
		INSERT INTO dbo.mdl_enrolments_PREVIOUSTERMCODE
			SELECT * FROM mdl_enrolments 
				WHERE courseid LIKE '%-MOODLE CATEGORY' 
				(MOODLE CATEGORY should be the same as dbo.mdl_category)
				
4) Change mdl_enrolments to union the new static table

5) Change the Scalar functions to the current term and category

6) If you want to create the courses immediately, run the following command via ssh on the moodle server
   or you can wait for the cron script to run overnight:
		
		php /var/www/html/moodle/enrol/database/cli/sync.php
	
7) If everything looks good, change the "Keep user enroled" option back to "Disable course enrolment" 
   during drop/add

8) Change the setting back to "Keep user enroled" after extended drop; ask DeAnna what that date is.
